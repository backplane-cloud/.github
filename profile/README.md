#  Backplane API

Project Backplane is an open-source Cloud Abstraction API for simplifying multi-cloud integration for organisations. It has been open-sourced by Backplane Software Ltd, a UK-based software development company building cloud tooling to simplifying multi-cloud integration. 

> [!NOTE]
> Backplane is currently looking for Beta Testers To find out more visit [Backplane Beta Program](https://backplane.dev/docs/beta/)



## Core Features

- **Account Vending**: Provision cloud accounts in **Azure**, **GCP**, **AWS** and **OCI**.

- **Access Data**: Retrieval of RBAC data across Cloud Service Providers
  
- **Policy Data**: Retrieval of Policy data
  
- *Cost Data*: Retrieval of Cost data (On Backlog)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Cost data retrieval functionality is on the Backlog as part of the Cost Extraction Engine. Cost data will need to follow an ETL-pattern before the API can consume cost data. 


## Features

- **Software Catalog**: A single source of truth for all Cloud workloads

- **Workflow Engine**: Create Requests for approval, scenarios include Budget approval, access approval etc.

- **App Templates**: Customise what environments to be created for different types of Apps

- **Service Integration**: Integrate third-party services like Github and add them to an App template so those services are onboarded automatically
